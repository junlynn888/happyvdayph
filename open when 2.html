It was really tough to think of what to give you (especially since someone is 9,967km away) so I hope you‚Äôll like this present :) I‚Äôve written a bunch of letters that you can open when you‚Äôre bored, sad, happy, etc. idk how fast you‚Äôll open them all, but anyway hopefully you‚Äôll like reading them!

It‚Äôs been around a month since you‚Äôve gone to Denmark, and while it has been hard, I wouldn‚Äôt trade the time we‚Äôve spent together (virtuallyü•≤) for anything else. Our calls and texts are always the highlight of my day, and I can‚Äôt wait for us to make more memories together ‚ù§Ô∏è

Looking forward to hearing about all your new adventures! Stay happy, safe, and healthy üòä

Missing you,
Jun Lynn`,
                happy: "I'm so glad you're happy! Your joy is contagious, and I love seeing your smile!",
                homesick: `Pretty sure you won‚Äôt really need to open this envelope often ‚Äì but it‚Äôs normal to feel homesick at least a few times, especially since you‚Äôre gone for so long üò≠.<br>
Not sure if this will make you judge me, but I was super homesick for the first two weeks when I was in London. Like crying and all even when my new exchange friends seemed to be having the time of their lives lol. Actually idk if this will even make you feel better, maybe it‚Äôs just outing me as a wimp ahahaha oh well.<br>
Basically my point is that even though you‚Äôre feeling homesick now, it passes really quickly. A quick call to my parents or sg friends made all the difference in the world to me. It also really helped to cook familiar dishes like chicken rice, kimchi fried rice, and‚Ä¶ er ok that‚Äôs it actually I can only cook like three things üòã but anyway just eat comfort food, keep yourself distracted, meet up with your friends from home in Europe whenever possible.<br>
Obviously, call me okay üòé I‚Äôll show you all the yummy food I‚Äôm eating like hokkien mee, pandan cake, caifan, fish soup so you can be jealous üëç.<br>
Yours,<br>
Jun Lynn`,
                miss: `Awww you miss me?<br>
Here‚Äôs a secret: I miss you too ü•≤. Obviously the closest thing to a solution would be to call me, but because of the wonderful time difference, abit tough ah ü•∫.<br>
So instead, here‚Äôs a few of my favourite memories of us so far!!<br>
‚ú® Watching squid game in rcgy at night ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt seem like much but I did really enjoy watching it with you‚Ä¶ (and aspen lol) thanks for lending me your pillow ü§≠<br>
‚ú® The time we spent together in Nanjing, specifically the museum visit. I‚Äôm not usually the biggest fan of pottery, but going through the exhibits with you made the trip really fun üôÉ so more museum visits next time?<br>
‚ú® That one night that we walked around the creepiest park in Hangzhou. Even though I may have been 20% scared I was going to get murdered, I think it was really fun to just explore the area ‚Äì and also it was the first time we really talked and got to know each other (i think?) sooo I really liked it hehe<br>
‚ú® Honourable mention: you scaring the shit out of me when you pressed the lift button even though I was in it‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve forgiven you for it actually üò°.<br>
‚ú® Of course, last but definitely not least, our first date. Thanks for planning such a sweet and thoughtful date ‚Äì I loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è.<br>
Come back soon so that this list can be updated üôÇ.<br>
Yours,<br>
Jun Lynn`,
                sad: "I'm here for you, no matter what. Let me be your shoulder to lean on. You're stronger than you think!",
                stressed: `Hey hey hey I thought someone damn good at studying??ü§î

haha jk, heard you were stressed out, so I‚Äôm here to give you some encouragementü´° first of all, don‚Äôt worry too much!! Remember ‚Äì you‚Äôre on exchange, so it‚Äôs pass/fail ok and there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll fail anything. You‚Äôve gotten through 4 sems of uni at this point and maintained such good results (FCH WORRRRR), c‚Äômon bro you‚Äôve got this üí™.

I would give you some advice on stress relief, but unfortunately I‚Äôm not sure my coping methods are the healthiest‚Ä¶ I think the best thing that helps me is just complaining about everything and anything to my friends and family. Of course, I also like to give myself sweet treats as rewards, and when I‚Äôm stressed, I‚Äôm super consistent with Wordle and Connections ‚Äì but I trust you have better self control and focus than I do ü´†.

Go on walks, cycle, enjoy the nice weather and Danish scenery. Talk to your friends and family more. And of course, call me whenever you want üôÇ I‚Äôm guessing that by the time you open this letter (unless you‚Äôve opened this even when you‚Äôre not stressed ‚Äì ok learn how to follow instructions next time ü§®), I‚Äôll be having my own breakdowns over my assignments, so hopefully you won‚Äôt mind my rants about school. I‚Äôll always be here for you ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Stay hydrated ‚Äì eat more fruits and vegetables!!
